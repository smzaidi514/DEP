## Task 1: Customer Segmentation for a Retail Store

### Description
The aim of this task is to analyze historical sales data to identify distinct groups of customers with similar purchasing patterns. Understanding these customer segments can help the retail store implement targeted marketing strategies, create personalized promotions, and improve customer retention. By identifying key customer segments, the store can better address the specific needs and preferences of each group, ultimately driving higher customer satisfaction and increased sales.

### Instructions
Steps to complete Task 1:
1.Data cleaning and preprocessing
2.Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3.Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means)
4.Visualization of customer segments

## Task 2: Predicting House Prices

### Description
The objective of this task is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on various features. The dataset contains information about houses, such as their size, number of bedrooms, and location. By analyzing this data, we aim to create a model that can accurately predict the price of a house given its attributes.

### Instructions
Steps to complete Task 2:
1.Data cleaning and preprocessing
2.Feature engineering
3.Model selection and training (e.g., linear regression)
4.Model evaluation and fine-tuning

## Task 3: Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Posts

### Description
This task involves collecting and analyzing social media data, such as tweets and Facebook posts, to gauge public opinion and sentiment about a particular product or brand. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we aim to classify the sentiment of these posts and visualize sentiment trends over time.

### Instructions
Steps to complete Task 3:
1.Data collection using APIs
2.Text preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, removing stop words)
3.Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques (e.g., VADER, BERT)
4.Visualization of sentiment trends

## Task 4: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic

### Description
This task involves analyzing network traffic data to identify patterns and detect anomalies that could signify cyber threats or unusual activities. By leveraging various anomaly detection algorithms, we aim to uncover deviations from normal traffic behavior, which could indicate potential security breaches or other suspicious activities.

### Instructions
Steps to complete Task 4:
1.Data collection and preprocessing
2.Feature extraction (e.g., packet size, time intervals)
3.Anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest,
Autoencoders)
4.Evaluation and validation of detected anomalies
